-How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

by seeing previous working version of the code.



-How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

i can see what worked and what didn't..and compare them, and get back to working version..it gives me confidence that
whatever i do in my code, i can always go back to working versions





-What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git,
 vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?


choosing manually to commit keeps the commits reasonable and useful..but sometimes it may be a problem to a forgetting person,
having versions recorded automatically can be useful when you forget to do commits..but it can record unreasonable, unworking changes





-Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, 
allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

because in some cases, a change in one file can affect other files






-How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
by comparing two commits





How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
it makes me more dangerous..because i can always undo any changes by returning to previous commit
