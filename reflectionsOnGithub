Hi There !


-When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

when i'm working with a team, or want to show my code to someone on the web
, i link my local repo to a remote so my teammates can clone it and make commits and push them to the remote and i can pull these commits












-Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

because sometimes other people make changes to the remote repo, and i might not want to have these changes in my local repo before checking them in Github..if i approved to have them in my local repository, i pull them














-Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

we fork a repo in github to have our own version of it in our github account.
we clone a repo in github to have it in our local machine.
a branch is a bunch of commits.

(the fork is the cloned repo that's in your github account)















-What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?


Accessing the remote repo even if you're offline..for example you can merge the origin/master branch with the master branch locally        


















github intervened
