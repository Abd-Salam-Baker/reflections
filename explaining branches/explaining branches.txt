let's say i want to experiment a feature..it may work or not(i wanna test it..or Demo it)...
but i still want to proceed with my code regardless of this feature..
i create a branch for this feature and start experminiting in this branch..while the main branch is not affected..
and if the feature finally worked, we merge the branches\


you can think of it like context switching..everytime you wanna do something new(new feature..try new bug fix),
you create a branch for it..
that's how you make your history easy to read and you can go back to your master branch at anytime(if the experiment fails)
