-What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

a .git file get initiated..because we want to store the history of the repository






-How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

the staging area should contain the files involved in a commit, the working directory is the files of the repo not including git files,
the repo contains all the files(working directory and git files)....the staging area is made to specify what files are involved in a commit
