-What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

a .git file get initiated..because we want to store the history of the repository






-How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

the staging area should contain the files involved in a commit, the working directory is the files of the repo not including git files,
the repo contains all the files(working directory and git files)....the staging area is made to specify what files are involved in a commit

the staging area also reperesents the latest commit
(if you run the command git diff with no arguments..you will be comparing the latest commit with the current version of the code)




-How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

by running the commad git diff --staged..i'm comparing the last commit with the staging area..this will
help me see what i did in the the commit that i'm going to do..and help me write the commit message
